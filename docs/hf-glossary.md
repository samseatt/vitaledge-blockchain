### **Hyperledger Fabric Glossary**

This glossary provides a comprehensive overview of general blockchain concepts, their definitions, and how they are represented in Hyperledger Fabric. It includes mappings to specific terms, files, and configurations used in Fabric. The purpose of this glossary is to provide a quick reference to key blockchain concepts and their representation in Hyperledger Fabric - the blockchain framework on which vitaledge-blockchain project is built.
