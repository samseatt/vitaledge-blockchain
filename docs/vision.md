#### **4. Key Features**

##### **4.1 Private Blockchain Implementation**
- **Consensus Mechanism**:
  - Use a lightweight consensus algorithm, such as Proof of Authority (PoA), to ensure fast and energy-efficient operations.
- **Node Management**:
  - Operate nodes on secure VitalEdge servers.
  - Optionally extend nodes to trusted healthcare partners for distributed operation.
- **Block Structure**:
  - Each block will store:
    - Timestamp
    - Hash of the previous block
    - Event details (e.g., data upload, system access, medical action)
    - Cryptographic signatures for verification.

##### **4.2 Hybrid Blockchain Architecture**
- **Private Blockchain**:
  - Handles all VitalEdge-specific logging needs.
  - Designed for low latency and high throughput.
- **Public Blockchain Integration**:
  - Periodically commit hashes of private blockchain data to a reputable public blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin).
  - Ensures external validation of the private blockchain’s integrity without exposing sensitive data.

##### **4.3 REST API Interfaces**
- **Logging API**:
  - Allow services like **DataGate** to log events with metadata (e.g., patient ID, action type, timestamp).
- **Query API**:
  - Provide endpoints for administrators to search logs by criteria (e.g., patient ID, action type, date range).
- **Public Blockchain Integration API**:
  - Trigger periodic recording of VitalEdge Blockchain hashes on the public blockchain.
- **Audit and Reporting API**:
  - Generate system access reports and compliance logs.

##### **4.4 Security and Privacy**
- **Encryption**:
  - Encrypt sensitive event metadata before adding it to the blockchain.
- **Access Control**:
  - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for querying blockchain data.
- **Data Anonymization**:
  - Use hashed identifiers for patient and system metadata.

#### **5. Integration with VitalEdge Ecosystem**

The **VitalEdge Blockchain** will integrate seamlessly with existing and future modules in the ecosystem:

1. **DataGate**:
   - Logs all data ingress and egress events, including file uploads and data transformations.
   - Provides provenance tracking for patient data and catalog updates.

2. **Data Aggregator**:
   - Records IoT device data streams and processing activities.
   - Ensures provenance for real-time patient monitoring data.

3. **React Frontend**:
   - Tracks clinician and patient interactions, such as data views, edits, or approvals.
   - Enables secure auditing of user actions.

4. **RxGen and DataLoader**:
   - Logs genomic data annotation activities and catalog ingestion events.

5. **IoT Devices**:
   - Records device registration, status updates, and data streams.
