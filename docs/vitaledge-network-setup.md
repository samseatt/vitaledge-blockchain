# HyperLedger Fabric - VitalEdge Network

This document provides a detailed breakdown of **"vitaledge-network"** which is based on Hyperledger Fabric. This example is designed to help developers set up a local vitaledge network quickly, providing a working baseline for understanding its current implementation and developing new features. We will examine its architecture, directory structure, and how everything fits together.

The vitaledge-network structure is modular and closely follows and acknowledges the patterns developed by Hyperlogic Fabric architects. This includes how cryptographic material is stored, how channels are created, and how chaincode is deployed. Understanding that will help you effectively work with this Fabric-based blockchain.

## **Overview of the VitalEdge Network**
The **vitaledge-network** provides:
1. A **single-channel** network contaiinng a custom channel named `vitaledgechannel`.
2. Two organizations:
   - **Org1** (Clinicians) and **Org2** (Data Scientists), each with:
     - A CA (Certificate Authority)
     - A peer node (peer0.clinicians.xmed.ai, peer0.data-scientists.xnome.net)
   - Admin identities and MSPs for both organizations.
3. An **orderer** node (represented by a decentralized doctors' network - drx.network) for transaction ordering.
4. Scripts for managing the network (`network.sh`) and deploying vitaledge chaincode.

## **Test Network Architecture**
### **1. Nodes**
- **Orderer Node**:
  - Sequences transactions into blocks and distributes them to peers.
  - Single node: `orderer.drx.network`.
- **Peer Nodes**:
  - Store the ledger and execute chaincode.
  - Two peers: `peer0.clinicians.xmed.ai`, `peer0.data-scientists.xnome.net`.

### **2. MSPs**
- Each organization has an MSP, which defines its cryptographic identity.
- Includes admin, peer, and user certificates.

### **3. Certificate Authorities**
- Fabric CA servers issue certificates for peers, orderers, and admins.
- Two CAs:
  - **Org1 CA**: Issues certificates for Org1 participants.
  - **Org2 CA**: Issues certificates for Org2 participants.

### **4. Channel**
- VitalEdge channel: `vitaledgechannel`.
- Configured to include Org1 and Org2 with specified policies.

## **How Test Network Components Interact**
1. **MSP Creation**:
   - CAs issue certificates, and `registerEnroll.sh` registers identities (admin, peers, orderers).
   - Certificates are placed in the `organizations/` directory.

2. **Channel Creation**:
   - `createChannel.sh` creates a channel (e.g., `vitaledgechannel`) using the `configtxgen` tool.
   - The channel configuration is stored in `channel-artifacts/`.

3. **Joining Peers to the Channel**:
   - Peers use their MSPs to authenticate and join the channel.

4. **Deploying Chaincode**:
   - Chaincode is installed on all peers, approved by the organizations, and committed to the channel.

5. **Executing Transactions**:
   - A client submits a transaction proposal.
   - Endorsing peers simulate and sign the transaction.
   - The orderer creates a block, which is validated and added to the ledger by all peers.

## **Key Commands for Managing VitaEdge Network**
Here are some commonly used commands:

### **Starting the Network**
```bash
./network.sh up createChannel -c vitaledgechannel -ca
```

### **Deploying VitalEdge Chaincode**
```bash
./network.sh deployCC -ccn vitaledgechaincode -ccp ../chaincode/vitaledgechaincode -ccl go -c vitaledgechannel
```

### **Querying the Ledger**
```bash
docker exec -it peer0.clinicians.xmed.ai peer chaincode query -C vitaledgechannel -n vitaledgechaincode -c '{"Args":["ReadAsset","asset1"]}'

peer chaincode query -C vitaledgechannel -n vitaledgechaincode -c '{"Args":["GetAllAssets"]}'
```

### **Invoking a Transaction**
```bash
docker exec -it peer0.clinicians.xmed.ai peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.example.com:7050 --tls --cafile /etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca/ordererOrg/ca-cert.pem -C vitaledgechannel -n vitaledgechaincode -c '{"Args":["TransferAsset","asset1","newOwner"]}'

peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.example.com:7050 --tls --cafile /etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca/ordererOrg/ca-cert.pem -C vitaledgechannel -n vitaledgechaincode -c '{"Args":["TransferAsset","asset1","newOwner"]}'
```
